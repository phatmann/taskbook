A new way to slice up tasks

TODO:
* Use timestamp instead of serial ID
* Store updated timestamp
* Provide way to merge two collections (for sync)
* Get rid of owners field, use event binding instead
* Get rid of itemXXX events, just use changed events for collection and item?
* Provide sync back-end based on node.js
* Switch to customizable views displayed singly:
  * Pagination
  * Sorting
  * Goal/action display
  * Filter
